# NLP-disaster-tweets
 Classifying the given tweets as disastarious or non-disastarious. Using various approached varying from a simple Naive-base modelling to using bert model. A started project to understand NLP !
 
 ### Details 
 - This model can distinguish and classify a tweet as disastarious or non-disastarious).
 - Currently on a acccuracy of 80% with the base model , work in progress will be updated soon.
 - Once it's done I will try to deploy it on the web too !
 - It is a part of Kaggle competitons , you can find the description here: [NLP with disaster tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started)
 - Trying this to get good grasp of NLP basics
### Updates :
 - Used the BERT model to get an accuracy of 84.6% (on test case)
 - The code is almost finalised , will update with the steps required soon.
 - The finalized model of the Naive-Bayes appraoch has bee added which can get us to an accuracy of ~80% on Kaggle!

#### Note :
- If you like it , do star it and play with it yourself by forking it !
